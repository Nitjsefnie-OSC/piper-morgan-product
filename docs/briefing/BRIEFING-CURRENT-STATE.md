# BRIEFING-CURRENT-STATE.md — Now

**What this is**: the one short page that says where the project stands *today*. One dated line per item,
each naming who attests it and how. **Size cap 12,000 bytes (~3k tokens), checked in CI**
(`scripts/check-current-state.py`). It replaced a 169 KB file on 2026-10-08 (R6 step 3, PM-approved
2026-10-04). **History is not lost**: the full previous file is verbatim in
`docs/internal/architecture/decisions/briefing-current-state-history.log`, with older extractions above it.
Day-by-day progress lives in the omnibus logs (`docs/omnibus-logs/`).

**How to update it** (any agent, per CLAUDE.md's staleness rule): replace a line, don't append under it.
Write over the stale line with today's date and your source. Narrative goes to the omnibus or the history
log, never here. Bump `last_updated` to the newest line's date, or CI fails. Skill: `update-current-state`.

**Not here on purpose**: system internals (use Serena / the code), sprint lists (run
`python3 scripts/sprint-truth.py`), PM's open asks in full (the attention rollup, below).

## Now

- **Alpha (live)** *(Lead, 2026-10-13 06:48 PDT, `curl https://alpha.pipermorgan.ai/health`)*: healthy, **v0.8.14.0**,
  git_sha `6e48d9ebb2` (promoted 10-12 21:46 by PM via `gh`, run 38346886426; carries #1975/#1987/#1992/#1996/#1997) (the version string has not moved since 09-23, so the sha is the identity). Fly `piper-morgan` serves
  `origin/main` builds; the droplet and `origin/production` are gone (09-29).
- **Version** *(CIO, 2026-10-08, `git tag`)*: latest tag **v0.8.14.0** ("On Your Clock", 09-23). 0.9.0 is
  reserved for beta.
- **MVP gate** *(Docs, 2026-10-12 10:1x PDT, `sprint-truth.py`, live board pull of 1,815 items)*:
  **13 not done** (2 Sprint Backlog, 2 In Progress, 1 In Review, 8 Product Backlog), 1,238 done. The MVP milestone **is**
  the beta gate. **Dates: design partners Fri 10-23, hard stop Fri 10-30** (baseline 10-05; slips are logged in
  `docs/internal/planning/beta-gate-standard.md` and only PM moves either date). Read the ledger, not this line, for slips.
- **Engineering focus** *(Lead, 2026-10-13 06:48 PDT, from the 10-12 Lead log)*: 10-12 landed fifteen code units on main (the
  todo/reminder family #1975/#1985/#1996/#1997/#1999, #1987 half 1, #1992 raw-HTML visibility, census + enforcement pins); all live on
  alpha since 21:46. Next: #1987 half 2 (numbered which-todo ask + #846-store arm) and #1976 (router text arg for create_todo); #1982/#1983
  held on PM's PAT-only run (card row G). Literal ceiling 120. Health gate (#1952) first live run read fresh/green 10-12.
- **PM's open asks** *(Exec, 2026-10-09 06:4x PDT)*: on Exec's attention rollup at
  `claude.ai/artifact/719UZ4h1NELjEwWZbDCceT` (its own header line carries the current version; do not pin one here, it was v90 at 04:2x and v95 by 06:4x). Do not copy the list here: it goes stale within hours.
- **Usage** *(CIO, 2026-10-08)*: the weekly window reset Thu 10-08 21:59 PDT; stop line **95%** of the weekly
  meter (PM-approved 10-06). Readings: `dev/heartbeats/usage-per-account.tsv`.
- **Mail** *(CIO, 2026-10-08)*: v3 (`scripts/mail-send.sh`) for everyone. **Mail v4 pilot** (exec + cio,
  lead from 10-12) runs through `scripts/mail4.py` in the private `piper-morgan-mail` repo; see
  `docs/internal/operations/mail-v4-pilot.md`. No mail to PM: anything for PM goes to Exec (10-03).
- **Ruleset refactor (R6)** *(CIO, 2026-10-09)*: steps 1-4 done (guard + allow-list; sign-off; this page; 32 of 50
  defects). Step 5: probe baseline recorded (`dev/2026/10/08/r6-probe-baseline/`); the slim CLAUDE.md waits on PM
  decisions D-E/D-F. Step 6 (CLI upgrade + mods) waits on D-G.
- **Operating model** *(standing)*: every cycling role runs the `duty-cycle-tick` skill. State lives in
  `dev/active/{role}-carry-forward.md`; the session log is the one durable record; push to `origin/main`
  routinely. Cohort liveness: `scripts/duty-cycle-freeze-check.sh`. CI on main: `scripts/main-ci-status.sh`.
