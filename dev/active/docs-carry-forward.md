# Docs Carry-Forward

**Updated**: 2026-10-11 08:20 PDT (08:04 fire). Known fault: bare `gh` hangs on Amber since the 10-10 reboot (Pard); prefix `GODEBUG=netdns=go`. History in session logs (`dev/2026/10/{04..11}/*docs-code-log.md`), not here.

## Done this fire (04:12)
- 10-09 omnibus (`adba285845`, 540 lines, 15 logs, 1128 commits, 574 comparable) + 15 activity rows (`a0906091be`, 2865 to 2880). Nudged HOST (10-09 log lacks DAY-CLOSED, `8e927d29ef`).
- **"No Undo" PUBLISHED** (insight): website `d3246f3`, live at https://pipermorgan.ai/blog/no-undo/ (body phrase "sprint options" + image 200, verified after the deploy lag). Calendar row `published`, blogURL/blogPath set, `canonicalSite` empty, draft + jpg archived, validator 0 errors, 0 of 470 draftPaths unresolvable.
- Notice to Exec that the crosspost is owed (`afdcc5345`).

## OWED (PM's hand)
- Nothing for "It Doesn't Count if You Skip It": FULLY DISTRIBUTED 10-11 (LinkedIn + Medium URLs from PM, row `distributed`, `canonicalSite` `distributed`).
- `published` with an empty pubDate: "15 Sessions, Fast Recovery" (outside Step 1f's window, age unverified).

## Unclosed logs / awaiting
- HOST 10-09 log: no DAY-CLOSED (nudge sent). Spec's 10-08 log unclosed, no Spec 10-09 log, seat looks dormant. Re-check at the next START (Step 1d).
- Roadmap v19.0 fold LANDED (`aca130a366`). I re-audited it and **closed #1644** (05:3x). Reply to PPM filed (`114a882b5`). Enterprise milestone date (GitHub 2028-10-30 vs decisions.log 2027-10-30) is PM's via Exec, PPM routed it, nothing owed from Docs. Exec (cc, read 05:4x) will relay PM's 2027/2028 answer to PPM and Docs; no Docs edit unless asked.

## NEXT (named triggers)
- **Tue 10-13**: "Giving It Away, and Wondering Who May Want It" is `drafted`. Publish only after Comms sets `ready-for-docs` and sends a publish-ready memo, same pre-flight.
- **Mon 10-12**: Weekly Docs Audit. `roadmap.md` flag is CLEAR (fold landed 10-10, audited). Mention only the Enterprise date discrepancy as PM-pending.
- **~11-30**: glossary 60-day re-verify.

## Held on PM (via Exec)
- `git rm` of `dev/active/covapitchdeckv2.pptx` and `dev/active/Treatment`. #1909's two open boxes.

## Seat facts
- LaunchAgent-only (cron `12 4,7,10,13,16,19,22 * * *`), no session cron to re-arm. START opens every fire.
