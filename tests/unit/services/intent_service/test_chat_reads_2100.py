"""#2100 — what chat can read from each connector is declared by code, rendered on the
floor's integration lines, and the floor is told never to promise a read not listed.

Web, #1386 scenario C3 on alpha e801b1a309: "what CAN you actually do right now?" offered
"Connect my Notion" as what "would solve" summarizing Notion docs; no chat path reads Notion.
Arch's ruling (issue 2100): a CHAT_READS map beside the readers, rendered per integration
line, an empty entry renders the can't-read sentence, one NEVER rule in the floor addendum.

LAYER: the declaration, the renderer (ConversationalFloor._format_domain_context) and the
addendum text. DENOMINATOR: every connector in the display set; every declared reader symbol.
