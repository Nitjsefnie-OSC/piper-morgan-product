# whats-armed.sh — one probe of what is actually armed on this host, with the layer each check
# measures and a denominator. Agent 360 v0.5 candidate 2 (CIO's 9.2, "name a mechanism you believe
# is running, and say how you last verified it"); xian "on board" 2026-10-13 via HOST.
#
# Replaces asking eleven seats to each probe a hook. Run it from any worktree; read-only except for
# the guards' own temp files. It never runs a git or fly command on your behalf.
#
# Layers, named per line (m-43):
#   live   — Claude Code itself ran the hook (only Pard's verify-hooks drumbeat measures this)
#   script — the hook script, run directly with a synthetic tool payload, gave the expected exit code
#   file   — present, executable, matches its tracked source; nothing was run
#   state  — a process or store reports itself (launchctl, the heartbeat store)
#
# Exit 0 = nothing NOT ARMED; 1 = at least one NOT ARMED. Unmeasured lines don't fail the run.
# Concept: docs/internal/operations/whats-armed.md. Owner: CIO. Review: 2026-12-08.
